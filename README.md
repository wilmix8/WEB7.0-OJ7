# WEB7.0(OJ7)
=============

WEB7.0(OJ7)  is  otherwise  known  as OJava7.0 and it is  invented in year 2013 in Jdk1.6 and it is further modified in 
DotWeb3.0 Research Language at Year 2021,2023,2024,2025.

OJAVA7(JAVA7.0) Programming Language is invented by wilmix jemin j at year 2013,2016 in java(jdk1.6) ,DOTWEB3.0. and
 OJAVA7(JAVA7.0) is a World Rank A' Programming Language and it is focused on creating DataStructures,Console Application with Wnosql DB, 
and used in web application and Used in Remote X application and it has Advanced Oops.But OJava7 windows application is present in JDollarShell
 not present in OJava7(JAVA7.0). OJava7(JAVA7.0) has Advanced concept like Bucket,Extend,etc. But in JdollarShell only J$Shell GUI,Graphics are found.
 Remote X application is Advanced than Python,Webapplication,and all programming Languages.So Say Good bye to olden web application.
 OJava7 is otherwise known as OJava7.Because many Tech Guys think it as java7 version. 

It is used in Remote X application which is not opensource.Because Remote X application is different from webapplication 
and this concept is invented by Wilmix Jemin j.This Remote X application and Remote web Application are not one.
 Remote web application is advanced than remote X application. This Remote X Application and Remote Webapplication is confidental
 from illegal hackers or another illegal persons who want to copy all my features in their research product and they will implement it.

It also supports obfuscation, Code Security, and it is Learnable. It is easy to learn. JAVA7.0 means Jemin Advanced Virtual Application.
 JAVA7.0 is even Advanced than Python Programming language and all programming Languages.OJava7(JAVA7.0) Linux version is implemented in C/C++,
 Java,Dotweb3.0 at year 2021.

OJava7(JAVA7.0) Linux version  is  implemented  in  C/C++, Java,Dotweb3.0 at  year  2021.

Definition:
==========

â€œJAVA7.0   is  meant   for  obfuscation, Code Security, Learnable, Advanced ,console based application with wnosql db,
Remote X Application and which is used  in Software  development, web application with machine learning  , and  it  symbolizes  
STAR  symbol,  used  in  applications  like  Console , used  with  java/j2ee  framework  like
Struts, spring , hibernate ,etc, and Java7.0 is also used in Machine learning and datascience. And one of most advanced Framework in 
OJava7(Java7.0) is  scroll framework ,It is  also  used  to  create  single webapplication".
          
The Meaning of OJAVA7  is OAK + Jemin Advanced Virtual Machine  OAK gives the meaning Beginning.

What is the Expansion of Ojava7(JAVA7.0) Programming Language ?
===============================================================

Expansion  of  Ojava7(JAVA7.0)  is

J  stands  for Jemin   , A stands   for Advanced , V stands  for  Virtual , and  A  stands for
Application   , 7 -> stands  for   wise  Programming  Language, O -> Stands for Olive.


ABOUT Ojava7(JAVA7.0)
=====================


Ojava7(JAVA7.0) Programming Language is otherwise  known  as  OJAVA7(JAVA7.0)
  which is  invented by  wilmix jemin  j  at  year  2013 in  java ,DOTWEB3.0.
This   two  versions  of  JAVA  (Jdk1.8,jdk1.7)  failed  that  is  using  JAD  decompiler  we  can   
easily  take   the  source   code.. But using OJava7 we  can't take the code.
We  felt   thanks  to my  best  friends  venkat  friend ,  github ,  and  all  for  their   support..


ADVANTAGES of JAVA7.0
=======================

a) JAVA7.0 behaves like his parent java and JDollar

java fails completly in code security. 

but java(jdk1.8,jdk1.7) is used with JREE in linux platform.

b) JAVA7.0 supports Garbage collection and explicity memory.

c) JAVA7.0 support Multiple inheritance ,friend function, and operator overloading

and all C/C++ oops concepts.

d) JAVA7.0 also supports CDollar concepts.

e) JAVA7.0 is used to create games which cannot be achieved in cdollar and gdollar.

f) JAVA7.0 also includes C# oops concepts.

g) JAVA7.0 also follows attractive syntax.

h) It have  100% oops concepts.

i) JAVA7.0 is used with JDollar,CWEB section, JAVA, C#, and with all writ Programming languages.

j) OJava7(JAVA7.0) provides high security for Web / Remote-X application

k) OJava7(JAVA7.0) contains Optimized code.

l) We know Tree datastructures are more complex to solve it for any Programming Language 
OJava7 (JAVA7.0) can easily solve this complex datastructures like Drag and drop the child 
of tree1 and put that child in another tree , CRUD operations in Tree,etc.

m) In case of programming language like C# or Java or PHP or Python or any other P.L ; 
source code can be taken using code reflector for C#. For Java , Code can be taken using JAD compiler , 
and for other programming language except C/C++. For Php,Python Code security is absent. 
.But OJava7 source code cannot be taken . So C/C++ , Ojava7 are the most securable programming Language.
 So no need to worry about code security.



Note: Due to this High security Remote -X Application , High security Webapplications ,Other Advantages,
solving complex problems, and Other Concepts So it is Ranked as World Rank A' Programming Language

Note: OJava7 has more advantages than i given above..


 ABOUT  OJAVA7 with MachineLearning and  Datascience History
==============================================================

J@ framework from  J$part2 focused for Mathematical statistics and  Datascience.
and  such  concept is removed already  and  updated  in  ojava7(Java7.0)...
and  now  only  mathematical  statistics concept  is  now found in j@  at  JDollarpart2..
So  J$ give his  concept to  Ojava7.
Now JDollar(J$)  real  rank  is  Rank z'''.   
So  JDollar(J$)  use   machine learning and  datascience before python
uses  machine learning and  datascience.
Jdollar(J$),OJava7 and  all other  writ  programming language
is  not  concenterated  in  AI  and  creating robots.

About OJava7 Divisions
=========================

OJava7 is  divided  into  6 types

i) Scroll Server with OJava7 (.web) and OJava7 (.ojava7)

ii) Scroll Server with  Java/j2ee and Java (jdk1.8) compiler 

(Note: Here Ojava7 compiler is not used,instead of that Jdk1.8 compiler is used
with ScrollServer.Because  Hibernate, Mybatics ,Java Spring are written in Jdk1.8 
That's why Ojava7 compiler is not match with java/j2ee frameworks
Hibernate, Mybatics ,Java Spring ,and EJB.
so Jdk1.8 versions and  next versions of  Jdk1.8 will not be
supported to be used with Ojava7 compiler.
Here Jsp ,and Servlet will not work in Scroll Server.
but EJB and JMS will work with Jdk1.8 at scroll server. You can see the sample for hibernate in SAMPLES SECTION.
ie) In Ojava7 google site (Sample-2:Topic: Write   a JAVA7.0 program  with Scroll Program,
here Jdk1.8 compiler is focused).
(We advice Java Spring should optimize the source code.So Java(jdk1.8) 
professionals are permited to be used with most popular server which is Scroll Server.
)

iii) Scroll Server with (.java7) with Ojava7 (OJAVA7.0) compiler

iv) Machine Learning and  data Science with  UserFriendly frameworks (OJ7UA).

v) Ojava7  Advanced Samples with  (.web) and  Ojava7 Console Application.

vi) OJava7  with Remote X Application (Advanced Application) ( Not released now).

=====================

Doubtful FAQS?
==============


1) Can OJava7 compiler work  with  Jdk1.8 and java/j2ee frameworks ?

No.

2) Can Ojava7 compiler compile Jdk1.8 programs ?

No, It will not accept jdk1.8 and other jdk1.8 versions.

3) Is Ojava7  is the competitor of Java/J2ee?

No , Ojava7 business is very different when compared

to Oracle business.

4) Is OJava7 work as a Standalone application?

Yes, it will work without the help of Java/J2ee applications.


5) Is OJava7 a high security Programming Language?

Yes.

======================================================

Ojava7 Security
=================
OJava7 provides high security when compared to all the programming languages.
We can see this medium security in detail ,which is  invented at year 2020.

Note:
====
This is  about Ojava7 medium security. But it is free for
the OJava7 developers to focus. But Ojava7 has Advanced high security
that  will be  mention in Enterprise edition and not
at  professional edition.


Why Ojava7 P.L is the best and top programming language than python P.L?
======================================================================

i) Both Ojava7 and java/j2ee  is like  english fluent language.

but python is not a english fluent language.

ii) Using Ojava7  we can reduce the  lines of code.

python is not  easy for the  developers to focus  when it reduce the lines of  code...

iii) Ojava7 and Java/j2ee follow camel case and can be adjusted  at any style with beautiful arrangement 

using Intellij IDE. But Python is failed in indentation.

iv) OJava7 is an beautiful programming language with attractive syntax and with few lines of code than python programming Language.

v) OJava7 module Ojava8 is  best  in Mobile computing.

Note: OJava7 has more advantages than python p.l which are hidden 
from  any hackers.

Difference between Java(Jdk1.8) and Ojava7?
===============================================

Both Java and Ojava7 is used in webapplication and
console application.But Java follows cloudcomputing
OJava7 follows Remote-X Application.OJava7 is
not used to create a software like VB.net and
Java Swing. OJava7 is used only with java frameworks like hibernate
and Mybatics, it is not used with Java Spring ,the reason is Java Spring code is
very bulk. This Java Spring web/ standalone application
is very slow when compare to Node.js,OJava7(JAVA7.0).
OJava7 is invented in Dotweb and java(jdk1.6).Java Spring
takes more time to develop a webapplication when compared to OJava7,Node.js.
And OJava7 has Advanced datastructures when compare to Java(Jdk1.8).
eg) Pipe,Bag,etc.Remember OJava7 is not the competitor for Java,C#,
python,etc. OJava7 is an interactive programming language. Java is
not a interactive programming Language.OJava7 is used in MachineLearning,
Datascience,mobile application,and single page application.
It supports obfuscation, Code Security, and it is Learnable.
OJava7 follows attractive and beautiful Userfriendly framework
(.oj7ua).OJava7 follows Shortest  function Statements.OakJava7 is
focus on Code Security.OJava7 is used with WNOSQL Database which provides 
high security...OJava7 is a standalone programming language.
That is without help of any available java frameworks 
OJava7 will able to create  webapplication,etc.OJava7 is
a Pure OOPS Programming Language. And Java/j2ee is not a
Pure OOPS Programming Language.OJava7 saves  time and  cost
and OJava7 is a highest securable programming language.
OJava7 will compile and run the OJava7 program
at the same time. but Java(Jdk1.8) can't do it.


Who may  focus OJava7(JAVA7.0) ?
==================================
 For OJava7 ,OJava7 machinelearning,OJava7 data science only C or  C++ or C# & Dotnet or Java/j2ee
Professionals  can focus and  read the samples. Because it is designed like this.


For OJava7 Programming Language tutorial see :
https://sites.google.com/view/ojava7programminglanguage

Note:  
=====

As  only  1%  of   JAVA7.0(OJAVA7)   features  is  published  for
professionals  but  many  features  of  ojava7(JAVA7.0)   is  hidden  from   users..
Since   they  may    copy    the  features   and  try  to  implement  it...
OJava7  is not  released  now. It has no  bugs.
OJava7  will  come at  any time that you don't expect it.
In OJava7  first version itself we will cover 
80%  the  concepts of  Machine learning and Data Science.
and  remaining concepts will be covered in OJava7 second version.


Syntax for OJava7 Machine Learning
=====================================

 <OJ7ML> // Beginning of OJava7 ML Program

<DESIGN  



// Design is the HTML GUI or variable declarations or method declarations


SRC='

// Method declarations

public static void Methods1()
{




j7out.println("");






}



'> 


//Close Design for GUI

</DESIGN>	

//Mention name of Package value in Package always mention wnosql as a default value for the Database. 

// Mention OJava7 library files for machine Learning  in J7Lib eg) Java7ML 

// Mention Package as ML , Names as sampleml1 for namespace name and class name as misctype1

// Mention Type as .exe or .dll 

<OJava7 Package='ML' Database='wnosql' J7Lib='{Java7ML}' Names='sampleml1,misctype1' Type='exe'  




//Mention MAIN section for OJava7 main program ie) public void main() can be  written as MAIN

// Mention what are the Business logic methods inside the main program eg) Methods1(),Methods2() in the MAIN section

 MAIN=' 


// Methods call

Methods1();
Methods2();









// This ( ?> ) is  equivalent to }}.Close the Main Section
?>
'
//LOGIC sections represent Business Logic for OJava7
LOGIC=' 

  
//Business logic methods
public static void Method2()

{

<!----- write Business Logic and  use OakJava7 Servlet ----!>

}





// Close the Logic section
'>


// Close  the OJava7 program 
</OJava7>


// End of  OJava7 Program
</OJ7ML>



Explanation 
============

Here when you code the Machine Learning program  using this syntax, it will automatically convert to
OJava7 program ie(.web) . And you will get a optimized OJava7(.web) code and .exe and .ojava7 files.
You can also test the  OJava7 Machine Learning program using (.web) code...So when we notice that here <OJ7ML> 
act like a OJava7 user friendly framework. It act like a XML syntax with data present inside it.
This Machine Learning program (<OJ7ML) will automatically generate (.web). This (<OJ7ML>) 
program has attractive syntax.So it is considered as a OJava7 advanced framework or 
OJava7 Machine learning framework. I reduces the pain of writing program for (.web).
And It saves time and  cost.The Full form of <OJ7ML> program is "OJAVA7MACHINELEARNING". 
It is used for Dynamic Webpages construction ie) DB with GUI + Business Logic and OakJava7 Servlet.
We can also generate .dll  using this syntax by using .dll value as a Type.
So when you include .exe value as a Type means when you compile the ojava7
it will generate the  .exe files and  .ojava7 files.
